<p><img src="img/char_1a.jpg" width="140px" class="img-rounded" style="float:right; margin:0 0 20px 20px;">A large part of humanity has been destroyed by a global nuclear war between China, Russia, North Korea and the USA. This global catastrophe has radically changed the world order. Since there was a lack of any necessary supply, a pandemic raged for many decades, to which many people fell victim. The fallout is spreading over a large area and therefore the earth is almost uninhabitable.</p>

<p>After years of searching, a small group was able to identify some areas that were not radioactively contaminated. In 2080, the rest of the people in these areas tried to create a new livelihood. The radioactive fallout made life impossible. The great war and its devastating destruction of our home planet forced people to flee. Mankind was forced to leave the earth.</p>
    
<p>On different parts of the earth, different factions came together to build space ships under high pressure in order to bring as many people as possible into space and to saving a part of humanity.</p>
    
<p>After a flight of several months through the undiscovered depths of space, you have finally discovered a planet. Planet Alpha.</p>

<div style="border-bottom:1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.20); margin:30px 0 30px 0;"></div>

<p>At first, the planet makes an uninhabitable impression. After several days of intensive searching, the crew finds a suitable place to establish the new colony. It can't be ruled out with certainty that there are other living beings on the planet, but that is secondary for the time being. For the time being only survival counts. The crew disassembles their spaceship to use the material for the construction of a base. After some days of hard work, the base was created. Raw materials have to be mined to expand the base.</p>

<p>Tip: Explore your planet and be careful with resources. Decide wisely which buildings to build first.</p>

<p>It was raining. The howling of the energy converters and Pulsor motors was heavy over the mud track marked by deep furrows. Landcrawlers with wide crawler tracks used the runway several times a day to transport raw materials from the uranium mines to the spaceport and supplies from there to the settlement.</p>

<p>Landcrawlers are huge trucks of 8-10m width, 10-20m height, and over 100m length. Mostly consisting of a tractor on two pairs of tracks, a semi-trailer with another pair of tracks, as well as another trailer consisting of a semi-trailer with an additional track drive as coupling to the front semi-trailer. Why Jack Steel volunteered for the safety team that secured the track, he couldn't say today, almost a week later, because the payment was moderate, it had been raining for 4 days without a break and the construction of the game barriers along the perimeter was more than sluggish.</p>

<p>One could not claim that Jack Steel was particularly attentive after an uneventful week in the increasingly colder air of the beginning winter. Something in the corners of his eyes suddenly caught his attention. Adrenaline washed through his body in the moment of shock.</p>
